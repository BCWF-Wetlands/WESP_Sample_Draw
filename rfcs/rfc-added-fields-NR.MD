- Reference Issues: NameX needs to know that a NR is consumed or expired (consumption date and corp_num of entity that was created)

# Summary

consumption date and corp_num of entity were not copied from NRO to Namex. Figured out where they missed and fix them in codes and SQL

# Basic example


# Motivation

We need to copy consumption date and corp_num of entity from NRO to Namex database, so these data can be used by front-end aspect in the future.

# Detailed design

1.	Add ‘CONSUME’ and ‘EXPIR’ to namex_pkb.sql. I am not sure if you need to have additional row_action value for the row_transaction_type_cd in (’CONSUME’, ‘EXPIR’). If so, we need to update codes in another section of namex_pkb.sql
2.	Add fields to \namex\nro-legacy\sql\object\names\namex\view\names_vw.sql
3.	Add fields (consumption_date, corp_num) to get_names(session, request_id) in \namex\api\namex\services\nro\request_utils.py
4.	Add fields (consumption_date, corp_num) to add_names(nr, nr_names) in \namex\api\namex\services\nro\request_utils.py
5.	Add field (corp_num) to model \namex\api\namex\models\name.py
6.	Add ‘CONSUME’ and ‘EXPIR’ type to \namex\api\tests\python\nro_services\test_update_request.py and rerun test
7.	Add fields to \namex\api\tests\python\models\test_names.py and rerun test
8.	Add fields to \namex\api\tests\python\nro_services\test_nro_request_utils.py and rerun test
9.	Add fields to \namex\api\tests\postman\xxxx-postman_collection.json and rerun test.



# Drawbacks


# Alternatives


# Adoption strategy

This implementation will break some old test cases so we need to update related test cases as well.

# Unresolved questions


# Thanks
