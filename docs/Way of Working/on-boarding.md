# This is currently a work-in-progress. - Feb 4, 2021

This is an on-boarding checklist for when we have new devs join the team. Though portions will apply to any new team members joining.

**Actions Required by Existing Team**
Product Owner
* Complete and submit the "BC-ROS onboarding form"

Scrum Master
* Update team member contact list
* Invite to Scrum team ceremonies
* RocketChat - Anyone with RC access can go to https://reggie.developer.gov.bc.ca and invite a friend

Release Train Engineer
* Invite to Sprint Review

**Actions Required by New Member**
* Github - Create Github account -  https://github.com/join - need this user ID and email to request access to OpenShift
* OpenShift - Request GitHub access to the BCDevOps org (https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues) and then an admin for our namespace can approve it
* ZenHub - Requires a github account with 2-factor authentication enabled and then anyone on the SRE team can provide access


For follow up:
* Update our Skills Matrix and this form to be a part of each new hire's onboarding - https://forms.gle/3XMi2LHweeiSTgNF9
* We should group people up when training, if the timing allows for it
* Independent of their area of development focus, each new dev should have a walk the whole backend, walk the whole frontend code and bits, then everyone has maybe the same base to start from.
* An overview of each product from a user point of view
