    - What are the common components? List of all the common components
       - https://github.com/bcgov/sbc-common-components/tree/master/vue/sbc-common-components
    - Common components vs Components
    - how is it being decided a components has to be converted to common components?
    - Is there a process, if not, can we implement someone?
