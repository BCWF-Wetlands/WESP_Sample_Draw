UAT - This needs to change
----

**Note**
- Staff has access to ZenHub
- Users Stories contain business language and staff should be able to understand stories (Ideally)
- only ask staff to " UAT" changes that impact them directly. This can be Staff filing. 
- UAT implies that there is an 'acceptance/sign-off' before going to market. 
  - This is not true for BC ROS.
- What UAT means for Staff in BC ROS:-
  - We don't need acceptance for all changes with staff, but what they need is awareness and understanding so they can support the client. 
  - Staff needs to be engaged early on, so staff feel a part of the process and have an opportunity to provide insight and business knowledge that may be needed for the design
  - If a change is more complex and impacts the client, staff may need a "hands-on" opportunity to preview the changes prior to going live (not UAT) to ensure they understand how it will be used so they can support the client. 
- Since the above is not actual sign off/acceptance from staff, we are calling this activity as "Exploratory testing".
- During the OCM checkpoint, we review upcoming releases and work on the change plan...part of that planning is asking staff if they would like some hands-on time to preview the changes or UAT (e.g., for a staff filing like Corrections) before going live. 

**Process**

**Entities: - We understand that for Entities:**
- This has to be confirmed
PO or BA labels the relevant stories/ ZenHub items to for the appropriate release 
Decision is made which stories/ items are relevant for UAT(Exploratory testing)
John approves going to Exploratory testing


**Questions**
- how do we know what item/ stories are relevant for (Exploratory testing) - and how do we make sure it is clear? OCM Lead will review all changes planned for a release and ensure changes are noted in change management (CM) plans. CM Plans are reviewed with PO's and with the business operations staff. 
- how many days before the release they should start or finish (Exploratory testing)? For filings/changes that only impact staff, it will depend on the degree of change. Ideally, two weeks before market release date, in case changes are needed and re-testing is required. 
- how long does staff need for (Exploratory testing)? It will depend on the degree of change. 
- how are they informed about when they can or should do testing? BA/OCM can coordinate and let staff know.
