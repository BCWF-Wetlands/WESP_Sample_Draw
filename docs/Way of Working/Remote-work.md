**Remote Work Summary and Recommendations**

•	Two stand-up meetings (15 min. each) everyday -> beginning of the day and close of the day 
•	Turn on your camera, i.e. use video feature, and add photos to your profile. The best angle for your camera for warmth and power is straight on, with eyes at camera level.
•	Insert a picture of you or the team when communicating with the whole team
•	Start with a round robin to get participants engaged early on, e.g. 30 second introduction, update, quick win, or just greeting.
•	To avoid feedback delay have a face-to-face conversation via chat or phone 
•	Follow conference- and communication etiquette (speak clearly, avoid noise around, etc.) 
•	One person should take the lead and facilitate, as body language is not existing. If you notice some people are not getting a chance to speak up, call on them by name.
•	Leverage chat function: You can use chat as a quick poll or pulse check. For example: “Everyone, please type into chat right now, on a scale of 1-10, how much do you like this idea?
•	Help with tech, offer tech support, training and check-in before a meeting if tech is working
•	Use the power of mute button: Invite participants to mute, avoid distracting sounds 
•	Use screen share and whiteboard- and other collaboration tools, to create a virtual work space
•	Find a good chair and lift your screen to eye level
•	Know who to contact re tech support and internet connection 
•	Use a headset with a built-in mic for high-end sound quality 
•	Ask your coworkers to share photos of their workspaces, so you can inspire one another
•	Mental stop-button: Have one seat at your table or one corner of the room be designated as the work space allows the brain to create separation. 
•	Publish calendar in advance – and all team member participate 
•	Make it social: Enable virtual team building through online coffee meetings, games and more by planning 30 minutes a week.
•	Define Sprint Goals: Define success in terms of outcomes rather than just hours. 
•	Prioritize: Start each day by deciding on your 1-3 most important tasks you should do first.
•	Take mindful breaks and move your body in-between 
•	Make your work visible, e.g. create a shared visual dashboard and provide status in daily scrum and or team chat
•	Log-in a few min. earlier to socialize with team members, like you would if pass in a hallway
