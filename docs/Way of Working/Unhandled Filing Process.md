**Comments:**
Thor (2020-01-03): "We are supposed to opne an issue for any filings that come in, and prioritize those in the coming Sprint. An alternative that was put forward was to list each filing (there's ~15 of them) prioritize those and get Outputs designed as well as rules for processing and implement the back-end for them.
We have about 1 month (2 Sprints) from when a paper filing comes in, to being able to process it."
